# Azure End-To-End Data Engineering Project - AdventureWorks Sales Analysis

---

## Introduction

Welcome to the Azure Data Engineering project! This project demonstrates building an end-to-end data pipeline to analyze and derive insights from the AdventureWorks sales dataset.  We leverage modern data engineering and analytics techniques using various Azure services.

## Overview

This project focuses on building a dynamic, end-to-end pipeline using Azure technologies.  We ingest, process, analyze, and visualize the AdventureWorks sales data, employing a medallion architecture for data storage.  This architecture helps organize the data into different layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) for varying levels of processing and refinement.

## Project Goals 

*   Ingest data dynamically from [Github as Source of AdventureWorks dataset as CSV files]
*   Transform and cleanse the data for analysis.
*   Store the data in a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
*   Perform data analysis and generate insights.
*   Visualize the insights using [Power BI].
  

## Technologies Used 

*   **Data ingestion and Orchestration:** Azure Data Factory.
*   **Data Storage:** Azure Blob Storage (for raw data/Bronze layer), Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (recommended for Silver/Gold layers for performance and hierarchical namespace).
*   **Data Processing /Transformation Azure Databricks.
*   **Data Lakehouse:** Azure Synapse Analytics  
*   **Data Visualization:**  Power BI.

## Architecture (Highly Recommended)

Include a diagram of your architecture.  Even a simple hand-drawn diagram or a basic diagram created in a tool like draw.io will greatly enhance the README.  The diagram should show the flow of data from the source to the various layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and the tools used at each stage.

## Data Flow (Suggested Addition)

Describe the flow of data through the pipeline:

1.  **Ingestion:** How is the data ingested into the Bronze layer? (e.g., Copy activity in ADF, Spark read from source, etc.)
2.  **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):** What is the purpose of the Bronze layer? (e.g., Store raw data in its original format.)
3.  **Silver Layer (Cleaned and Transformed Data):** What transformations are performed in the Silver layer? (e.g., Data cleaning, standardization, enrichment, etc.)
4.  **Gold Layer (Aggregated and Modeled Data):** What is the purpose of the Gold layer? (e.g., Store aggregated data ready for reporting and analysis.)
5.  **Analysis and Visualization:** How is the data analyzed and visualized?

## Setup and Deployment (Suggested Addition)

Provide clear instructions on how to set up and deploy the project:

1.  **Prerequisites:** List all the required Azure resources and software.
2.  **Deployment Steps:** Outline the steps to deploy the pipeline (e.g., Deploy ARM templates, publish Data Factory pipelines, configure Databricks clusters, etc.).
3.  **Configuration:** Explain how to configure the pipeline (e.g., Connection strings, data source locations, etc.).

## Usage (Suggested Addition)

Explain how to use the pipeline:

1.  How to trigger the pipeline.
2.  How to monitor the pipeline execution.
3.  How to access the results.

## Contributing (Suggested Addition)

If you want others to contribute to your project, add contribution guidelines.

## License (Suggested Addition)

Specify the license under which your project is distributed.

## Next Steps (Suggested Addition)

What are the future plans for the project? (e.g., Add more data sources, implement real-time processing, etc.)
